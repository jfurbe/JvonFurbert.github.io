# PacMan Exersice
Here we are animating a Pacman image and using the js functions to recognize the boundaries. Making the pacman 'bounce' around the screen. The 'eating' animation is achieve by swaping out two different images one open and one closed. 

## How to run 
Add pacman and then click the start button. Add more pacmen as desired.


### Roadmap of furture improvements
Need to mmake animations better.
